This repository contains most indicators and analyses produced by the KOF Swiss Economic Institute at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich (https://kof.ethz.ch/en/).

Wherever possible, the data are accessed with the "kofdata" package that provides conventient wrappers around the KOF API (https://cran.r-project.org/package=kofdata).

When available, the methodology is included in portable document format (PDF).
