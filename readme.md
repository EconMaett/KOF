This repository contains most indicators and analyses produced by the [KOF Swiss Economic Institute at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich](https://kof.ethz.ch/en/).

Wherever possible, the data are accessed with the [kofdata](https://cran.r-project.org/package=kofdata) package that provides convenient wrappers around the [KOF Dataservice API](https://datenservice.kof.ethz.ch/).

When available, the methodology is included in portable document format (PDF).
